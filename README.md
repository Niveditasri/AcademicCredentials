# AcademicCredentials Smart Contract

## Overview

The `AcademicCredentials` smart contract provides a decentralized solution for issuing, verifying, and revoking academic credentials using the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures the authenticity and immutability of academic records, thereby preventing credential fraud.

## Features

- **Issue Credential:** Authorized institutions can issue academic credentials to students.
- **Verify Credential:** Anyone can verify the authenticity and details of an academic credential.
- **Revoke Credential:** Issuing institutions can revoke a credential if necessary.
- **Authorize/Deauthorize Institutions:** Only the contract owner can authorize or deauthorize institutions to issue credentials.

## Smart Contract Details

### Data Structures

- **Credential Struct:** Contains information about a credential:
  - `address institution`: The address of the issuing institution.
  - `string studentName`: The name of the student.
  - `string courseName`: The name of the course.
  - `uint256 issueDate`: The timestamp when the credential was issued.
  - `bool isRevoked`: Indicates if the credential has been revoked.

### State Variables

- `address public owner`: The owner of the contract.
- `mapping(address => bool) public authorizedInstitutions`: Tracks which institutions are authorized to issue credentials.
- `mapping(bytes32 => Credential) public credentials`: Stores credentials by their unique ID.
- `mapping(bytes32 => bool) public credentialExists`: Tracks the existence of credentials by their unique ID.

### Events

- `event CredentialIssued(bytes32 indexed credentialId, address indexed institution, string studentName, string courseName, uint256 issueDate)`: Emitted when a credential is issued.
- `event CredentialRevoked(bytes32 indexed credentialId, address indexed institution)`: Emitted when a credential is revoked.
- `event InstitutionAuthorized(address indexed institution)`: Emitted when an institution is authorized.
- `event InstitutionDeauthorized(address indexed institution)`: Emitted when an institution is deauthorized.

### Modifiers

- `modifier onlyOwner()`: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute certain functions.
- `modifier onlyAuthorizedInstitution()`: Ensures that only authorized institutions can execute certain functions.

### Functions

- `constructor()`: Initializes the contract and sets the deployer as the owner.
- `authorizeInstitution(address institution)`: Authorizes an institution to issue credentials (only owner).
- `deauthorizeInstitution(address institution)`: Deauthorizes an institution (only owner).
- `issueCredential(address student, string calldata studentName, string calldata courseName)`: Issues a credential to a student (only authorized institutions).
- `revokeCredential(bytes32 credentialId)`: Revokes a credential (only issuing institution).
- `verifyCredential(bytes32 credentialId)`: Verifies the details and validity of a credential.

## Deployment

### Deploying with Remix IDE

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Create a New File**: Name it `AcademicCredentials.sol` and paste the smart contract code.
3. **Compile the Contract**: Ensure the compiler version is 0.8.0 and click "Compile AcademicCredentials.sol".
4. **Deploy the Contract**: Select the environment (e.g., Injected Web3 for MetaMask), choose `AcademicCredentials` from the dropdown, and click "Deploy". Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### Deploying with Truffle and Infura

1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Install Truffle globally: `npm install -g truffle`
   - Create a new project directory: `mkdir AcademicCredentialsProject && cd AcademicCredentialsProject`
   - Initialize a new Truffle project: `truffle init`

2. **Install HDWalletProvider**:
   ```sh
   npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
   ```

3. **Create a Migration Script**: In the `migrations` folder, create `2_deploy_contracts.js`:
   ```js
   const AcademicCredentials = artifacts.require("AcademicCredentials");

   module.exports = function (deployer) {
       deployer.deploy(AcademicCredentials);
   };
   ```

4. **Add the Smart Contract**: In the `contracts` folder, create `AcademicCredentials.sol` and paste the smart contract code.

5. **Configure Truffle**: Edit `truffle-config.js`:
   ```js
   const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
   const infuraKey = "YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
   const mnemonic = "YOUR_METAMASK_MNEMONIC";

   module.exports = {
       networks: {
           rinkeby: {
               provider: () =>
                   new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/${infuraKey}`),
               network_id: 4,
               gas: 4500000,
               gasPrice: 10000000000
           },
       },
       compilers: {
           solc: {
               version: "0.8.0"
           }
       }
   };
   ```

6. **Deploy the Contract**:
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```

## Testing and Interaction

### Using Truffle Console

1. **Open Truffle Console**:
   ```sh
   truffle console --network rinkeby
   ```

2. **Interact with the Contract**:
   ```js
   const instance = await AcademicCredentials.deployed();
   await instance.authorizeInstitution("0xInstitutionAddress");
   await instance.issueCredential("0xStudentAddress", "John Doe", "Computer Science");
   const result = await instance.verifyCredential("0xCredentialId");
   console.log(result);
   ```

## Conclusion

The `AcademicCredentials` smart contract provides a secure and decentralized platform for managing academic credentials, ensuring authenticity, and preventing fraud. It leverages the immutability of blockchain to offer a reliable solution for academic institutions and students alike.
